<div class="page-about">
  
  <p>Kenneth is a Program Manager at Microsoft and lives in Vancouver, Canada, where he leads the next generation of web developer tooling. He's a Global Shaper for Word Economic Forum, serves on multiple advisory boards, and is a frequent public speaker who travels the world.</p>

  <p>Kenneth has been all connecting dots over the last decade. He quit his gas station clerk job at 16 to code web scrapers, and fell deeply in love with the web, so he took a job at a newly acquired startup, ZYB, and saw it grow from 15 people in a basement to 100.000 people in skyscrapers around the world in Vodafone. He then once again went back to the basement and joined Hoist (later Podio), and helped take the startup on a very similar journey from basement to skyscraper, when Citrix bought the small Copenhagen-based company in April 2012</p>
    
  <p>Recently, he skipped the basement for a change, and went straight to Microsoft on a mission to get browsers to talk to text editors and to enable everyone to build the developer tools they need for the web.</p> 

  <p>Getting things and people talking isn't a new thing for Kenneth. During the last decade he repeatedly asked himself why everything isn’t as connected as it could be.</p> 


  <h3>Why don’t browsers talk to text editors?</h3> 
  <p>
  With the RemoteDebug initiative, Kenneth enables exactly that — a potential rethink of how we code for the web, and how a new generation of tooling can be built. He now works as a Program Manager at Microsoft to get that conversation going. 
  </p>

  <h3>Why is can't I just talk to people without installing software?</h3>
  <p>Literally by expensing the project costs to his own credit card, Kenneth disrupted Citrix’s flagship GoToMeeting video conferencing platform from within, by building a peer to peer video meeting system, that avoided complicated signup flows, expensive severs and annoying latency.</p> 

  <h3>Why don’t startups talk to startups?</h3>
  <p>Cliques and a lack of international visibility led to a new non-profit, #CPHFTW. Kenneth joined from the start and helped unite the Danish tech scene, spawning the #CPHFTW platform, hashtag and pieces international media like <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/edmundingham/2015/11/06/48-hours-on-the-copenhagen-start-up-scene-what-i-learned/2/#263c5e186f91">Forbes</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/mar/10/cool-copenhagen-startup-community">The Guardian</a>, and <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/15672dc4-1fdb-11e5-ab0f-6bb9974f25d0.html">Financial Times</a></p> 

  <h3>Why doesn’t JavaScripters talk to other JavaScripters?</h3> 
  <p>Being the only front-end guy at Podio, and lacking inspiration and solutions from others, Kenneth asked on Twitter, “why don’t we all meet?” One month later, equally frustrated engineers knocked on the door to the Podio office, and just a few years later CopenhagenJS has grown to 1.000+ members with meetups in both Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmö, Sweden.</p> 

  <h3>Why doesn’t the international front-end industry talk to the Danish crowd?</h3>

  <p>One of the products of the CopenhagenJS meetups was a desire to take the next step — an international conference, in Copenhagen, focusing solely on front-end. Along with a co-founder, Kenneth created ColdFront, invited speakers from all over the world, and had over 1.000 participants by selling out three years in a row.</p>

      <p>An online collaborative workspace system includes a set of first subsystems and a workflow subsystem. The first subsystems provide a project-oriented social network environment in which system users collaboratively interact with user-defined application objects that store user data and user-determined application functions executed to display the user data and interlink the application objects into project-scale organizations.</p>
